  \item Developed and tested a reusable JSON parser with async APIs
  to improve the startup time of the visualizer
  \item Rewrote the between-state transition system to handle multiple
  types of animation that takes place across several frames,
  improve developer experience, and address major
  pain points from Mechmania 2018
  \item Extracted the transition system to a separate package
  to be used in future Mechmania
  \item Creating different IO handlers for browser and desktop build
