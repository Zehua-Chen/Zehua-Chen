\begin{itemize}
  \item Make the tokens animate between game turns by implementing a message
  dispatch system
  \item Enable the visualizer to communicate with the backend by implementing
  a custom JSON parser that has more features than Unity's builtin JSON parser,
  using data structures like dictionaries, list, and stack
  \item Enable the visualizer to stream data from the backend by writing a
  WebSocket listener
  \item Reduced startup time by dividing JSON parsing to multiple threads
  \item Produced a feature-rick project by dividing work between multiple
  developers
  \item Ensured product quality by creating a modular architecture, writing
  unit tests in Unity and create manual tests
\end{itemize}
